# CLAUDE.md

Project context for Claude Code. Started from an earlier Claude Desktop session, then updated after inspecting the real data in `geopackages/`. Items marked **unverified** or **inferred** were not confirmed against documentation or a live system.

## What this is

A viewer for KYAPED (Kentucky) oblique aerial imagery. Imagery is served from S3 as COGs; frame metadata comes from the vendor's GeoPackages.

The repo's README title is `aerial-perspective-viewer` and the directory is `oblique-viewer`. The name is not settled.

## Repo hygiene

- Imagery, COGs, GeoPackages, and DB dumps must never be committed. `.gitignore` excludes these, including `geopackages/`. Don't `git add -A` blindly. Check `git status` first.
- Dev environment is WSL2 Ubuntu on Windows. ArcGIS Pro stays on the Windows side.
- Local tooling that works: `docker`, and the `duckdb` CLI with the `spatial` extension (`LOAD spatial; SELECT ... FROM ST_Read('file.gpkg')`). `ST_Read` takes one file, not a glob. Not installed: `ogrinfo`/`ogr2ogr`, `sqlite3`, GDAL or geopandas for Python.
- The analysis so far was ad hoc DuckDB queries. None are saved in the repo.

## Data model (verified against `geopackages/`)

Four seasons (2022 S2, 2023 S1, 2023 S2, 2024 S1), 20 GeoPackages in two folders, all EPSG:3089 (NAD83 / Kentucky Single Zone, US survey feet). Schemas are identical across seasons.

Per season:

- **ImageFrames**: polygon ZM footprints. Z looks terrain-projected (**unverified**).
- **ImageFrameCentroids**: the same attributes as Frames, as points. Redundant.
- **ImageFrameEO**: 3D points with the exterior orientation and camera intrinsics. Also present in `flight-orientation/` with identical row counts (contents not compared row by row).
- **ImageFrameBoundary**: one polygon per season.

Columns:

- **Frames:** `Filename`, `FlightDate`, `FlightTime` (local), `TimeZone` (`EST (-5)`, `EDT (-4)`, `CST (-6)`, or `CDT (-5)`), `FL`, `ShotID`, `CameraID`, `Year`, `Season`, `S3URL`.
- **EO:** `ID`, `X`, `Y`, `Z` (State Plane feet), `Omega`, `Phi`, `Kappa`, `FlightDate`, `FlightTime` (looks like UTC, checked on one row), `CamName`, `CamWidthPx`, `CamHeighPx`, `CamFocalMm`, `CamCCDResU`, `CamOmegaDg`, `CamPhiDg`, `CamKappaDg`, `CamPpxMm`, `CamPpyMm`.

Counts:

- 4,428,945 rows, or 4,384,880 unique frames. That is 876,976 exposures × 5 cameras (Color, Fwd, Bwd, Left, Right).
- There are 2,620 (season, `FL`) lines. The earlier "16-line sample" was probably all of 2022 Season 2.

### Keys

- **Primary key:** `Filename`, the prefixed key, e.g. `KY_KYAPED_2023_Season1_3IN/Bwd_0_40721.tif`. It equals the S3 key under `imagery/obliques/Phase3/`, and the EO `ID` is the same string without `.tif`.
- **URLs:** `S3URL` is that base plus `Filename` on every row. Store the base path once. `Phase3` is the only oblique collection. The bucket is in us-west-2, though the `S3URL` column uses the global endpoint.
- **`ShotID`:** it equals the basename without `.tif`. It is unique across seasons today, but don't use it as the key.
- **`FL`:** it repeats across seasons (67 values appear in more than one). Always use (season, `FL`).
- **Exposure key:** (season, `FL`, shot number). It groups exactly 5 cameras in 876,973 of 876,976 groups. In the other 3, one camera's image comes from a different day, apparently a per-camera replacement.
- **Two ShotID formats:** `Cam_FL_shot` (2022 S2, 2023 S1) and `Cam_YYYYMMDD_FL_shot` (2023 S2, 2024 S1; 674,755 rows). A parser has to handle both. Shot numbers aren't zero-padded, so sort them numerically.

### Duplicates

44,065 filenames appear exactly twice (2023 S1: 42,030; 2024 S1: 2,035). The attributes are identical, and the EO layer has the same duplicates. Dedupe on load, after confirming that geometry and EO values match (**not yet checked**).

### Time

`FlightTime` in Frames is local time with a `TimeZone` label. Kentucky spans Eastern and Central time, and 599 lines contain more than one label. Convert to UTC on load (local time minus the offset in the label).

### Per-frame files on S3

- **`<basename>.tif`:** a COG with JPEG (YCbCr) compression and 512 px tiles. The sample `Bwd_0_40721.tif` is 10300×7700 px, 43 MB, with 3 internal overview levels. It **has no georeferencing** (the tiepoint is all zeros and there is no pixel scale). Position must come from the EO plus the DEM patch. Written by UltraMap. HTTP range requests work.
- **`<basename>.json`:** a small DEM patch. The keys are `cellSize`, `lowerLeftX`, `lowerLeftY`, `minimumValue`, `maximumValue`, `noDataValue`, and `value` (a rows × cols grid). The sample is 54 rows × 57 cols at a cell size of 50, with the lower-left corner in State Plane feet (5218765, 3480033), so about 2,850 × 2,700 ft, elevations 994–1426. Units (assumed feet) and row order (assumed top-down) are **unverified**, and I haven't checked the grid's coverage against a footprint.
- **The sample frame isn't in the layers.** `Bwd_0_40721` has `FL` 0, and no local layer contains any `FL=0` rows. Either the bucket holds images the layers don't list, or the layers are incomplete. Only this one file was tested.

## Project facts (from `metadata/KYSW_Obliques_KYAPED_Project_Metadata.xml`)

Vendor FGDC record from NV5 Geospatial, published 2025-07-17. The XML is on disk but not committed yet.

- **Acquisition:** Vexcel Osprey 3P and 4.1 cameras. One nadir camera plus four obliques at 45°. The metadata calls the obliques north/south/east/west. In the data they are Fwd/Bwd/Left/Right, so cardinal direction depends on flight direction.
- **Coverage:** 120 Kentucky counties plus 47 in neighboring states, about 41,349 sq mi. The metadata says 119 flight lines over 130 flight days, 2022-11-20 to 2024-04-07. The layers have 2,620 (season, `FL`) values and dates through 2024-04-13.
- **Imagery:** 3-inch GSD (0.217 ft average) at 5,883 ft above mean terrain. Non-orthorectified COGs, delivered to KyFromAbove and formatted for the vendor's Oblique Viewer.
- **Orientation:** nadir images are oriented to true north. Obliques are "horizon-up".
- **Overlap:** forward overlap averages 70% for nadir and 67% for oblique. Side overlap averages 46% for nadir and 40% for oblique.
- **Accuracy:** 0.674 ft RMSEr from 333 checkpoints. Far-oblique areas with GSD above 0.4 ft were excluded from that test, so far-field pixels are less reliable.
- **DEM:** the vendor used a DEM (KyFromAbove LiDAR plus NED) to project obliques in its viewer. The per-frame JSON patches look like that terrain.
- **EO source:** the metadata names the project's EO shapefiles as the source for omega/phi/kappa, coordinates, sensor dimensions, focal length, and CCD resolution.

## The heading problem (algorithm validated in Python on one season; not in SQL)

Don't trust the nadir camera's own Kappa for compass direction. Derive it instead:

1. Split each flight line into **passes** and, for each pass, compute the **ground-track heading** from consecutive Color-camera positions (`LAG`/`LEAD`), using a circular mean. Order by UTC time with shot number as the tiebreaker, not by shot number alone.
2. Each frame's compass direction is that track heading plus a fixed per-camera offset:

   | Camera | Offset |
   |--------|--------|
   | Fwd    | +0°    |
   | Bwd    | +180°  |
   | Left   | +90°   |
   | Right  | −90°   |

Checked in Python by the earlier session against the EO data for 16 lines (probably all of 2022 Season 2): mean error about 0.3–0.9°, max about 6° (attributed to aircraft yaw wobble). Not checked on the other seasons.

This derived heading is what the "look north" button and the frame-adjacency logic should query.

### Ordering and reflights (findings from the data)

Sorting Color frames numerically by shot number gives 422 backward time steps in 353 of 2,620 lines. A backward step in the `LAG` window would give a reversed direction vector, which is a 180° heading error.

- **Time zones** explain 258 of the 422 (local clock jumps at the Eastern/Central boundary). UTC-normalizing leaves 164 in 161 lines.
- **Reflights explain the rest.** 637 lines were flown on more than one date, and reflights are common. 155 of the remaining 164 backward steps jump back by more than a day.
- **The shot-number prefix looks like a pass marker** (**inferred**): numbers under 100000 are the original pass (prefix 0), and 1xxxxx, 2xxxxx, 3xxxxx are later passes. Within one date on one line the prefix is almost always constant (only 9 exceptions). 110,602 Color frames on 455 lines have shot ≥ 100000.
- **Original passes can also span days.** 393 of the 637 multi-date lines have one prefix, so they are one pass flown over adjacent days.
- **Reflights are often small and fill gaps.** Of 1,008 same-line date pairs, 620 have one side with 50 frames or fewer. One prefix-1 reflight (2023-03-29) bridges the gap between two original days on `FL 1029`.
- **Per-camera replacements exist.** In 3 exposures, some cameras come from a later day, e.g. `FL 1030` shot 101879 has Color, Fwd and Left from 2023-03-05 but Bwd and Right from 2023-03-29.

Design implications:

- **Define a pass** as (season, `FL`, `FlightDate`, prefix), and compute the ground track within a pass only. Add `pass_id` and a heuristic `is_reflight` flag (inferred, not from the vendor). Keep both the originals and the reflights.
- **Don't assume a line's direction.** The "8 lines north, 8 south, alternating" pattern came from one complete season. A reflight segment may be flown in either direction (**not checked**), so heading is per pass.
- **Short passes** (1–2 Color frames) have no neighbor to compute a track from. They need a fallback, such as the original pass's heading or the EO Kappa.
- **Which frame wins where several cover the same ground:** per the user, the reflight usually wins. That suggests a default rule of preferring the later pass (higher prefix, later date). The user said "usually", so there are exceptions, and none are identified yet. No per-frame quality or superseded flag has been found in the layers, so the rule can't be derived from the data alone.

**Grid north vs true north (unresolved):** the EO X/Y are confirmed State Plane feet, so headings computed from them are grid bearings. The Kentucky Single Zone central meridian is −85° and the state spans about −89.7° to −81.9°. The gap between grid north and true north can therefore reach about ±3°. Part of the 6° max error may be this convergence rather than yaw. This is a hypothesis. If the "look north" button needs true north, apply a convergence correction.

Planned indexes: a GiST spatial index on the footprint geometry, and an index on (`pass_id`, UTC time) for next/previous-along-pass lookups.

## Database

**Decision: PostGIS.** Run it locally or in a container for development, then migrate to RDS later. Docker runs in this WSL setup.

- Use the `geometry` type with GiST spatial indexes and `LAG`/`LEAD` window functions.
- SQL Server was considered and drafted (native `geometry`, `ogr2ogr` MSSQLSpatial driver), then dropped in favor of PostGIS. The user runs SQL Server elsewhere, but this project doesn't depend on it.

**Proposed, not decided:** normalize once with DuckDB into GeoParquet (dedupe, parse both ShotID formats, join Frames with EO, drop Centroids, convert times to UTC, add `pass_id`), then load PostGIS from that as the serving layer. At this scale (about 4.4M rows) don't partition by flight line, since that gives 2,620 tiny files. If Parquet is published, partition by season or season plus a coarse spatial tile, sorted spatially within each file. A browser-only design (Parquet plus DuckDB-WASM, no backend) is possible if headings and adjacency are precomputed. Decide whether there is a backend.

## Status

- Nothing is built yet. No schema, no loader, no app code.
- The earlier session drafted T-SQL files (`schema.sql`, `finalize.sql`, `docker-compose.yml`, `load.sh`, and a README) for SQL Server. **They are not in this repo and are superseded.** They were never run against a real SQL Server. At most they are a reference for the schema shape.
- Lessons worth keeping:
  - PostgreSQL lowercases unquoted identifiers, so handle the vendor's mixed-case column names on load
  - a load script should support both truncate-and-reload and append
  - the earlier design assumed one heading per `FL`, which the reflight findings above contradict

## Open items

- Reflights usually win (per the user). What are the exceptions, and how would they be identified? Is there any vendor documentation? Should the viewer let users switch to the original frame?
- Examine the 3 exposures with per-camera replacement, and check whether splitting by pass removes the remaining backward time steps (9 were under a day).
- Verify the JSON sidecar's units, row order, and coverage against a footprint, using a frame that is actually in the layers.
- Why is `Bwd_0_40721` (`FL 0`) in the bucket but not in the layers? Are there other such images?
- Confirm that the duplicate frames match in geometry and EO, and that the two EO folders match.
- Check ground-track direction on reflight passes, and re-check the heading rule on all four seasons.
- Rendering approach is undecided. Tile serving via titiler was floated.
- Frame-transition UX is undecided.
- The repo's final name is undecided.
- License: MIT, chosen by the author (a personal project for now, so the author sets the terms). If this later becomes agency work, check ownership before relicensing or accepting outside contributions. The imagery and metadata are NV5/KyFromAbove data and are not covered by this license.
